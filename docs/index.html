          <p>“Aisi chudai kabhi na kiya aur na hi dekha”, said popular <em>vendor</em> Miss Bubbly (name changed to protect identity).</p>

<p>The Goods and Services Tax (GST) reform hangs as a <del>swollen penis inside the pants</del> double-edged sword over the heads of the <em>entrepreneurs</em> of Delhi’s infamous red light district – G.B. Road. With the services being offered in the area finally coming under the special services bracket of the tax, the life and work of the <em>artists</em> in the area has finally been legalized. However, the services are taxed at a giggling 69% which has left the <em>employees</em> complaining.</p>

<p>“I have to say, it hurts but thoda toh mazaa aa gaya”, said a <em>proprietor</em>.</p>

<p>“Main toh abhi condom bhi nahi khareed pata hai so main safed panni aur rubberband chadha ke hi kaam chala raha hai”, said another.</p>

          <h4>Shiv Sena followers kill 100 militants out of exasperation</h4>

<p>After the frustratingly <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/mumbai-news/elphinstone-station-stampede-moments-that-led-to-stampede-caught-in-mobile-phone-video-1756740">deadly stampede at Mumbai’s Elphinstone railway station</a> yesterday, the Rail Ministry held a high-level meeting to avert future crises. The committee decided to reconstruct all foot overbridges in the City of (Ghastly) Dreams on high priority.</p>

<p>To showcase their pragmatism, the Railways began to tear down all the bridges at once; this while tenders are still being invited for the construction of the replacement bridges. “Kaal kare so aaj kar, aaj kare so ab”, said a senior official.</p>

          <h4>Male drivers lose jobs to better women drivers</h4>

<p>Women in the country gained the right to drive early last month in a move celebrated by feminist activist groups all over the world. However, an unsettling account has come up in the wake of protests by male drivers who are losing their jobs to women as the fairer sex has proved to be a more reliable and safer operator behind the wheel.</p>

<p>Who would have thought this would happen? If you ask Salim Smith, personal advisor to the King of Saudi Arabia, he would say – “I told you so.”</p>

          <h4>New India 2002?</h4>

<p>The Prime Minster today had to face great embarrasment after launching the ruling party’s New India campaign. In what was supposed to be a visionary target set for the year 2022 (when the country celebrates 75 years of covert subjugation of western powers), he tweeted the year 2002 instead.</p>

<p>The “accidental” typo led to a massive (yet unsurprising) shift in the rhetoric attached with the campaign as supporters of nationalist sentiments thought their dreams had finally come true.</p>

          <h4>The Majestic Mammal Displays Its Might Again</h4>

<p>The Blue Whale game has claimed yet another victim here today. The victim, a 14 year old <del>jackass</del> boy, claimed his own life by hanging himself from the balcony of his penthouse apartment in the elite S.O.B. Villas residential society.</p>

<p>“I just don’t get it… He was doing okay when I saw him last year”, said the victim’s mother via Skype. “We have been sending him a Snap everyday from the beach resort where we are celebrating our 7th divorce anniversary”, she added. He would often screenshot their Snaps and add himself in the oceanic background being eaten by a blue whale. When asked if that was probably a hint of his mental state, the father who is a Food Vlogger replied, “We thought he was being ironically macabre because everyone knows blue whales don’t eat humans.”</p>
