          <h4>PM left saffron-faced after a series of Twitter embarrassments</h4>

<p>The Prime Minster today had to face great embarrasment after launching the ruling party’s New India campaign. In what was supposed to be a visionary target set for the year 2022 (when the country celebrates 75 years of covert subjugation of western powers), he tweeted the year 2002 instead.</p>

<p>The “accidental” typo led to a massive (yet unsurprising) shift in the rhetoric attached with the campaign as supporters of nationalist sentiments thought their dreams had finally come true.</p>

<p>As if the Dera Sacha Sauda saga wasn’t convoluted enough, the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) today called a press conference to issue a memorandum to the Lucknow High Court calling for the release of dera chief Sant Guru Sri Sri Gurmit Ram Rahim Joseph Singh Insan Mahavir.</p>

<p>When asked for a comment, Justice Panwadi Lal of the honourable Lucknow High Court said - “Bro that’s not how this works.”</p>

          <h4>The Majestic Mammal Displays Its Might Again</h4>

<p>The Blue Whale game has claimed yet another victim here today. The victim, a 14 year old <del>jackass</del> boy, claimed his own life by hanging himself from the balcony of his penthouse apartment in the elite S.O.B. Villas residential society.</p>

<p>“I just don’t get it… He was doing okay when I saw him last year”, said the victim’s mother via Skype. “We have been sending him a Snap everyday from the beach resort where we are celebrating our 7th divorce anniversary”, she added. He would often screenshot their Snaps and add himself in the oceanic background being eaten by a blue whale. When asked if that was probably a hint of his mental state, the father who is a Food Vlogger replied, “We thought he was being ironically macabre because everyone knows blue whales don’t eat humans.”</p>

<p>Never one to let a successful PR strategy slide and always a proponent of new and immersive technology (who can forget the great hologram speech of 2014?), reports say that the Prime Minister has been fascinated by the Missed Call campaigns of late.

The Prime Minister’s Office today thus issued a statement stating the PM’s demand that he would do Prime Minsterley work such as brunching with international <del>supermodels</del> dignitaries, rehearsing for his radio show and delivering <em>kadak</em> burns in political rally speeches if and only if he receives 10 million missed calls each morning of the week; barring Sunday because that’s his rest day.</p>

          <p>If you’ve ever been in a situation where you’re unable to decide whether a puppy is cute or not, PETA is here to help.</p>

<p>The umbrella organization of saviours of <em>all</em> animal lives (except a few like humans and those icky slimy ones) has issued a definitive list of dog breeds that you are allowed to display unchecked emotions for. The list, dubbed ‘Cute or Not’, has been welcomed by a number of Social Media Influencers on Instagram, Twitter and Tumblr. One particular social media celebrity, John Smith of @gay&amp;atheist fame, said - “This is a God-send.”</p>

<p>Teenagers across the globe heaved a sigh of relief upon hearing the announcement. One home-schooler named Adam Smith said - “PETA always do me a great concern but now PETA G O O D B O Y E n fren.”</p>

<p>Or some other generic name like Bob or Mary.</p>

<p>Celebrity names are also a hit with over a 100 Beyoncés and 48 Justin Biebers registered at the City Office in just the last quarter.</p>

<p>“I can be sure that anytime someone tries to stalk a Beyoncé who gave them head at a bar in L.A., they are never going to head into my direction”, said Beyoncé.</p>

<p>Starbucks baristas have been the worst hit.</p>
