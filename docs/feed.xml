      <content type="html" xml:base="https://gsidhu.github.io/satirical-hearsay/2017/09/28/pm-left-saffron-faced/">&lt;h4&gt;New India 2002?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Prime Minster today had to face great embarrasment after launching the ruling party’s New India campaign. In what was supposed to be a visionary target set for the year 2022 (when the country celebrates 75 years of covert subjugation of western powers), he tweeted the year 2002 instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “accidental” typo led to a massive (yet unsurprising) shift in the rhetoric attached with the campaign as supporters of nationalist sentiments thought their dreams had finally come true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the original tweet has since been removed, we provide a screenshot below –&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt; 
The year is 2002 and India is the greatest country in the world. &lt;a&gt;#NewIndia2002&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ndash; Modi Ji (@UNApprovedBestPM) &lt;a&gt;Feb 28, 2002&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bjpitcell.org/&quot; title=&quot;Not related to Stephen King. But equally scary.&quot;&gt;IT Clown Circus&lt;/a&gt; of BJP went into turbo-charged mode soon as the tweet was issued and quickly published a list of addresses of Muslim households on its website along with an instructions manual on effective rioting written in Sanskrit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The top-brass of BJP and RSS were visibly jubilant and captured the ecstatic emotions in 140-character ultimatums –&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt; 
1992, 2002, 2022. Ghanti wahin bajayenge. &lt;a&gt;#NewIndia2002&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ndash; Advani Group (@ArchaicLivesMatter) &lt;a&gt;Dec 6, 1992&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt; 
Ey ganpat, chal daaru laa. &lt;a&gt;#NewIndia2002&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ndash; Amit Paan Masala (@12ShahShahShah) &lt;a&gt;Jul 25, 2010&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Panna Lal Kasai, a shakha worker from Varanasi said, &quot;हम तोह त्रिशूल निकाल के मस्जिद की तरफ चल दिए थे पर फिर कोई पीछे से बोले कि नहीं ऐसा गलती से हो गया है तोह हम रुक गए ... पर अब त्रिशूल तोह निकाल ही लिए थे तोह हम मौलवी साहब की बकरी मार ले आये&quot; (I took my trident out and was already on my way towards the mosque when someone said that it was a false alarm. So I stole the maulvi's goat instead.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the frenzy lasted only a couple of hours, the country as a whole is visibly unshook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Related: We overheard the following conversation at the chai stall outside our office –&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;Bro ever since demonisation I have an emergency suitcase ready with me at all times.&quot; &lt;br /&gt;
&quot;I have already filed papers for citizenship of Fiji Islands, moving there next week.&quot; &lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Sahi hai bro. Wahan ki bandiya bahut thhaa hoti hain.&quot; &lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Yep.&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content>

      <content type="html" xml:base="https://gsidhu.github.io/satirical-hearsay/2017/09/27/filmmakers-fight-for-dera-chief-release/">&lt;h4&gt;Gurmit Ram Rahim is a cultural icon claims FTII&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As if the Dera Sacha Sauda saga wasn’t convoluted enough, the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) today called a press conference to issue a memorandum to the Lucknow High Court calling for the release of dera chief Sant Guru Sri Sri Gurmit Ram Rahim Joseph Singh Insan Mahavir.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When asked for a comment, Justice Panwadi Lal of the honourable Lucknow High Court said - “Bro that’s not how this works.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Smith, an award-winning filmmaker who currently serves as the Chief Litigation Officer for the institute said that Gurmit Ram Rahim’s approach for gaining social and cultural validation is a motivational story and deserves a wider audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is a very post-modern concept… it breaks the existing structures of what defines a religious &lt;del&gt;cult&lt;/del&gt; sect and where the line between the bizarre and admirable lies”, said film critic Schwarz Pole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“He is a cultural icon”, added Smith. “We must preserve his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q48tagwurUw&quot;&gt;monumental contribution to Indian cinema and music industry&lt;/a&gt; the same way we preserve our 17th century Hindu ideals – he should be made Prime Minister.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“He has an international standing; it’s no joke that VEVO and Zee Music Company produced his hit numbers”, he went on to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In related news, Jawaharlal Nehru Univeristy (JNU), New Delhi, had organized a 3-day lecture series titled “Dera Pheri: An investigative analysis of India’s cult worshippers” last week wherein academicians from cultural and media studies offered their viewpoints on the country’s fascination with colourful circus leaders and why this fascination seems to be dominated by the saffron colour of late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add to this great academic effort, FTII is planning to launch a 1-year long certificate course dubbed “Phir Dera Pheri” that will provide students with the necessary knowhow enabling them to reliably predict the market value of deras across the country. The course will be available in distance learning mode for a nominal subscription of ₹1100 per month. Hotstar subscribers can survey the course for free but will have to pay extra for the certificate. Jio Mobile users will receive the certification for free regardless of their wish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Prime Minister has been keeping a tab on the happenings so far and believes that the certificate course will likely create employment opportunities in the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt; 
&lt;a&gt;@FTII #PhirDeraPheri&lt;/a&gt; commendable idea. Will boost private sector growth by 8% and bring fuel prices down by 1.2% &lt;a&gt;#NewIndia&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ndash; Modi Ji (@UNApprovedBestPM) &lt;a&gt;Feb 28, 2002&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FTII is the country’s premier filmmaking institute and has produced the careers of notable film actors like John Smith and Bob Smith.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <content type="html" xml:base="https://gsidhu.github.io/satirical-hearsay/2017/09/26/blue-whale-claims-another-victim/">&lt;h4&gt;The Majestic Mammal Displays Its Might Again&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Blue Whale game has claimed yet another victim here today. The victim, a 14 year old &lt;del&gt;jackass&lt;/del&gt; boy, claimed his own life by hanging himself from the balcony of his penthouse apartment in the elite S.O.B. Villas residential society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I just don’t get it… He was doing okay when I saw him last year”, said the victim’s mother via Skype. “We have been sending him a Snap everyday from the beach resort where we are celebrating our 7th divorce anniversary”, she added. He would often screenshot their Snaps and add himself in the oceanic background being eaten by a blue whale. When asked if that was probably a hint of his mental state, the father who is a Food Vlogger replied, “We thought he was being ironically macabre because everyone knows blue whales don’t eat humans.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know what got to him”, said the boy’s nanny who of course is now unemployed and in search for a new &lt;del&gt;victim&lt;/del&gt; job (contact at +919866698666, salary 1.6LPM non-negotiable).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The victim’s school friends remember him as being a nihilist and unironically morbid. “We saw True Detective together and he just really vibed with Rust Cohle you know”, said one of his classmates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students from his school have created an app in his honour that allows users to pay their respects remotely. The VR game called &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fusion.bluewhale&amp;amp;hl=en&quot;&gt;Blue whale VR&lt;/a&gt; lets users “Discover a blue whale facts through an immersive underwater exploration (sic).” The app has received mixed reviews with a disgruntled ‘E-MMA GRILLE’ giving it a 1-star review saying - &lt;em&gt;“useless app.nothing in it. its just a blue background. You also need a reality device to view it. There is nothing to do with the suicidal issue of a girl in russia. I think there is another issue for that.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People from all over the world are paying their respects on Twitter by using the hashtag #AlwaysBlue –&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt; 
Silicon Valley is the best show on HBO right now! &lt;a&gt;#AlwaysBlue&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This incident has taken the game to the number two spot on the Victim Leaderboard, still behind the reigning champion Flappy Bird. The game still ranks the highest, for the fifth week in a row, on the New &amp;amp; Rising Charts however.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html" xml:base="https://gsidhu.github.io/satirical-hearsay/2017/09/25/send-your-PM-to-work-today/">&lt;h4&gt;Call Your PM NOW! But don’t say anything. Your silence is what keeps him going.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never one to let a successful PR strategy slide and always a proponent of new and immersive technology (who can forget the great hologram speech of 2014?), reports say that the Prime Minister has been fascinated by the Missed Call campaigns of late. These campaigns were seen most recently in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://isha.sadhguru.org/rally-for-rivers/participate-give-a-missed-call-your-vote-to-save-our-rivers/&quot; title=&quot;Did I misinterpret their campaign?&quot;&gt;Trees For Free&lt;/a&gt; project run by the BABA foundation but have been around since &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/06/23/get-1-lac-votes-and-ill-clear-the-word-intercourse-in-jab-har_a_22584233/&quot; title=&quot;He said the word. Potty mouth.&quot;&gt;this sexual remark&lt;/a&gt; by the Chief Censor and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/%E2%80%98Missed-call%E2%80%99-campaign-makes-a-mark/article17290237.ece&quot;&gt;this seditious propaganda&lt;/a&gt; in the southern state of Tamil Nadu earlier this year. The Prime Minister’s Office today thus issued a statement stating the PM’s demand that he would do Prime Minsterley work such as brunching with international &lt;del&gt;supermodels&lt;/del&gt; dignitaries, rehearsing for his radio show and delivering &lt;em&gt;kadak&lt;/em&gt; burns in political rally speeches if and only if he receives 10 million missed calls each morning of the week; barring Sunday because that’s his rest day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In what is touted as a never seen before collaboration, Members of Parliament have cut across party lines to join the campaign as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bjpitcell.org/&quot; title=&quot;Not related to Stephen King. But equally scary.&quot;&gt;IT Clown Circus&lt;/a&gt; of the ruling political party accidentally misspelled the online hashtag and wrote #SendYourMPToWorkToday instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phone companies are particularly pleased with this as they are now offering targeted Value Added Services (VAS) that automatically call the PM each morning for a reasonable rate of ₹5/day. To those protesting against the cost the PM tweeted -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt; 
A cup of cutting chai + mathhi costs ₹5. Am I not worth it? &lt;a&gt;#chaipecharcha&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ndash; Modi Ji (@UNApprovedBestPM) &lt;a&gt;Feb 28, 2002&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one is as pleased as Jio Mobiles though since their offer of 100 free missed calls to all Jio Premium Elite numbers (there’s only one, you know who has it) has been a hit with the population with their subscriber count rising 666% within the last 12 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The announcement has snowballed into a massive advertising campaign with filmmakers fighting for Hello Tune rights to the PM’s mobile number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social workers, particularly of the JNU variety, have condemned the move, calling it “hilariously undemocratic” and are seeking a complete reversal. To which the PM tweeted -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt; 
Complete reversal? I'm not Kejriwal. &lt;a&gt;@AurAamZaada&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a&gt;#casualbanter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ndash; Modi Ji (@UNApprovedBestPM) &lt;a&gt;Feb 28, 2002&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon further pressure however the PMO has acknowledged the plea and has asked the reverse-campaigners to gather 11 million missed calls if they want to be taken seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court has chosen to remain silent on the topic perhaps because no one rung their bell.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;The umbrella organization of saviours of &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; animal lives (except a few like humans and those icky slimy ones) has issued a definitive list of dog breeds that you are allowed to display unchecked emotions for.

With this in view, residents of Christ City, Maryland have a novel scheme to offer – change your name to John Smith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or some other generic name like Bob or Mary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Celebrity names are also a hit with over a 100 Beyoncés and 48 Justin Biebers registered at the City Office in just the last quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I can be sure that anytime someone tries to stalk a Beyoncé who gave them head at a bar in L.A., they are never going to head into my direction”, said Beyoncé.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starbucks baristas have been the worst hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Story to be continued…&lt;/p&gt;</content>
