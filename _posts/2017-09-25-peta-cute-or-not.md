If you've ever been in a situation where you're unable to decide whether a puppy is cute or not, PETA is here to help.

The umbrella organization of saviours of _all_ animal lives (except a few like humans and those icky slimy ones) has issued a definitive list of dog breeds that you are allowed to display unchecked emotions for. The list, dubbed 'Cute or Not', has been welcomed by a number of Social Media Influencers on Instagram, Twitter and Tumblr. One particular social media celebrity, John Smith of @gay&atheist fame, said - "This is a God-send."

Teenagers across the globe heaved a sigh of relief upon hearing the announcement. One home-schooler named Adam Smith said - "PETA always do me a great concern but now PETA G O O D B O Y E n fren."
