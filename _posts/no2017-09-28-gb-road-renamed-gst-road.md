#### "We've never been f**ked like this" say the Red Light District's Entrepreneurs

"Aisi chudai kabhi na kiya, na hua aur na hi dekha", said Mary Smith (name changed to protect identity).

The Prime Minster today had to face great embarrasment after launching the ruling party's New India campaign. In what was supposed to be a visionary target set for the year 2022 (when the country celebrates 75 years of covert subjugation of western powers), he tweeted the year 2002 instead. 

The "accidental" typo led to a massive (yet unsurprising) shift in the rhetoric attached with the campaign as supporters of nationalist sentiments thought their dreams had finally come true.

While the original tweet has since been removed, we provide a screenshot below --

The <a href="http://www.bjpitcell.org/" title="Not related to Stephen King. But equally scary.">IT Clown Circus</a> of BJP went into turbo-charged mode soon as the tweet was issued and quickly published a list of addresses of Muslim households on its website along with an instructions manual on effective rioting written in Sanskrit.

The top-brass of BJP and RSS were visibly jubilant and captured the ecstatic emotions in 140-character ultimatums --

<p> Panna Lal Kasai, a shakha worker from Varanasi said, "हम तोह त्रिशूल निकाल के मस्जिद की तरफ चल दिए थे पर फिर कोई पीछे से बोले कि नहीं ऐसा गलती से हो गया है तोह हम रुक गए ... पर अब त्रिशूल तोह निकाल ही लिए थे तोह हम मौलवी साहब की बकरी मार ले आये" (I took my trident out and was already on my way towards the mosque when someone said that it was a false alarm. So I stole the maulvi's goat instead.) </p>

While the frenzy lasted only a couple of hours, the country as a whole is visibly unshook.

<blockquote>
"Bro ever since demonisation I have an emergency suitcase ready with me at all times." <br>
"I have already filed papers for citizenship of Fiji Islands, moving there next week." <br>
"Sahi hai bro. Wahan ki bandiya bahut thhaa hoti hain." <br>
"Yep."
