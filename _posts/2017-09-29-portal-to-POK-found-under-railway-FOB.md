#### Shiv Sena followers kill 100 militants out of exasperation

After the frustratingly [deadly stampede at Mumbai's Elphinstone railway station](https://www.ndtv.com/mumbai-news/elphinstone-station-stampede-moments-that-led-to-stampede-caught-in-mobile-phone-video-1756740) yesterday, the Rail Ministry held a high-level meeting to avert future crises. The committee decided to reconstruct all foot overbridges in the City of (Ghastly) Dreams on high priority. 

To showcase their pragmatism, the Railways began to tear down all the bridges at once; this while tenders are still being invited for the construction of the replacement bridges. "Kaal kare so aaj kar, aaj kare so ab", said a senior official.

While the steadfast working deserves attention, reality has turned into fiction at Andheri West railway station as workers seem to have found a portal to Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (POK) from underneath the overbridge site. 

An onlooker and a certified Potterhead remarked, "This is like Platform Number 9 2/11." We quickly moved away from her.

Pappu Nandan, who had just come to the city from his village to start a new life joined the construction workers soon as he deboarded the train. "I was sitting on top of the guard bogie and saw some people tearing down something as the train pulled into the station. I was immediately attracted towards it because mujhe laga ki mandir banana hoga wahan", he said.

It was only when he was about to take a chai break that his foot got stuck in the rubble and the floor around him began to sink in like quick sand. 

"I was knocked out but when I got up I saw that I was stuck in a trench. As I climbed out I was surrounded by a bunch of goatherders. I asked them where I was and they said in Pakistan. Well they said Azad Kashmir but I know there is no such thing so it must have been Pakistan only. I knew what I had to do, so I took a stone and killed all of them North Indian bastards. If they want to live in Azad Kashmir they should go to Pakistan. Bloody terrorists."

Vidhu Vinod Chopra has already claimed the rights for a film on Pappu's lifestory. 

The Shiv Sena was extremely frustrated by this incident. "These bastards were sitting under our nose all this time!", said an angry ~~militant~~ supporter. A "Sena" of 72 men rushed into the portal and killed 100 militants on the other side.

The Prime Minster was extremely pleased by this discovery and took to Twitter to express his elation --

The portal site is being touted unofficially as the Indian equivalent of Area 51 -- Khand 420. The Indian Army has taken charge of the site and has put orange traffic cones around it to prevent any illegal occupation.
