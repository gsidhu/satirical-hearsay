#### Gurmit Ram Rahim is a cultural icon claims FTII

As if the Dera Sacha Sauda saga wasn't convoluted enough, the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) today called a press conference to issue a memorandum to the Lucknow High Court calling for the release of dera chief Sant Guru Sri Sri Gurmit Ram Rahim Joseph Singh Insan Mahavir.

When asked for a comment, Justice Panwadi Lal of the honourable Lucknow High Court said - "Bro that's not how this works."

John Smith, an award-winning filmmaker who currently serves as the Chief Litigation Officer for the institute said that Gurmit Ram Rahim's approach for gaining social and cultural validation is a motivational story and deserves a wider audience. 

"It is a very post-modern concept... it breaks the existing structures of what defines a religious ~~cult~~ sect and where the line between the bizarre and admirable lies", said film critic Schwarz Pole.

"He is a cultural icon", added Smith. "We must preserve his [monumental contribution to Indian cinema and music industry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q48tagwurUw) the same way we preserve our 17th century Hindu ideals -- he should be made Prime Minister." 

"He has an international standing; it's no joke that VEVO and Zee Music Company produced his hit numbers", he went on to say.

In related news, Jawaharlal Nehru Univeristy (JNU), New Delhi, had organized a 3-day lecture series titled "Dera Pheri: An investigative analysis of India's cult worshippers" last week wherein academicians from cultural and media studies offered their viewpoints on the country's fascination with colourful circus leaders and why this fascination seems to be dominated by the saffron colour of late. 

To add to this great academic effort, FTII is planning to launch a 1-year long certificate course dubbed "Phir Dera Pheri" that will provide students with the necessary knowhow enabling them to reliably predict the market value of deras across the country. The course will be available in distance learning mode for a nominal subscription of â‚¹1100 per month. Hotstar subscribers can survey the course for free but will have to pay extra for the certificate. Jio Mobile users will receive the certification for free regardless of their wish. 

The Prime Minister has been keeping a tab on the happenings so far and believes that the certificate course will likely create employment opportunities in the private sector.
