#### The Majestic Mammal Displays Its Might Again

The Blue Whale game has claimed yet another victim here today. The victim, a 14 year old ~~jackass~~ boy, claimed his own life by hanging himself from the balcony of his penthouse apartment in the elite S.O.B. Villas residential society.

"I just don't get it... He was doing okay when I saw him last year", said the victim's mother via Skype. "We have been sending him a Snap everyday from the beach resort where we are celebrating our 7th divorce anniversary", she added. He would often screenshot their Snaps and add himself in the oceanic background being eaten by a blue whale. When asked if that was probably a hint of his mental state, the father who is a Food Vlogger replied, "We thought he was being ironically macabre because everyone knows blue whales don't eat humans."

"I don't know what got to him", said the boy's nanny who of course is now unemployed and in search for a new ~~victim~~ job (contact at +919866698666, salary 1.6LPM non-negotiable).

The victim's school friends remember him as being a nihilist and unironically morbid. "We saw True Detective together and he just really vibed with Rust Cohle you know", said one of his classmates. 

Students from his school have created an app in his honour that allows users to pay their respects remotely. The VR game called [Blue whale VR](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fusion.bluewhale&hl=en) lets users "Discover a blue whale facts through an immersive underwater exploration (sic)." The app has received mixed reviews with a disgruntled 'E-MMA GRILLE' giving it a 1-star review saying - _"useless app.nothing in it. its just a blue background. You also need a reality device to view it. There is nothing to do with the suicidal issue of a girl in russia. I think there is another issue for that."_

People from all over the world are paying their respects on Twitter by using the hashtag #AlwaysBlue --

This incident has taken the game to the number two spot on the Victim Leaderboard, still behind the reigning champion Flappy Bird. The game still ranks the highest, for the fifth week in a row, on the New & Rising Charts however.
