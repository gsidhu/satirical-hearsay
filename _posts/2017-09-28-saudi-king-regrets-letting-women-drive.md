#### Male drivers lose jobs to better women drivers

Women in the country gained the right to drive early last month in a move celebrated by feminist activist groups all over the world. However, an unsettling account has come up in the wake of protests by male drivers who are losing their jobs to women as the fairer sex has proved to be a more reliable and safer operator behind the wheel.

Who would have thought this would happen? If you ask Salim Smith, personal advisor to the King of Saudi Arabia, he would say -- "I told you so."

The situation is such that many of the leading taxicab and transporation companies have begun to prefer women drivers over all men regardless of experience. "Women are just too good at this thing!", exclaimed one mysteriously jubilant taxicab owner in Riyadh. Another told us that he only hires women truck drivers for his shipping company since they are reliable and have years of experience of surviving under harsh conditions. "It's almost as if we did them a favour by not letting them drive all these years", he added.

Witnessing the widespread protests in the country by the disgruntled darker sex, Salim Smith took to Twitter to provide an insider's account of why women weren't previously allowed to drive.

It was a well thought-out strategy to stop women. They were always too good. Advised the King to not risk it. Didn't listen.<br>

Turns out that the King had conducted experiments behind closed doors back in 1968 and 1992 wherein female drivers were pitted against their male counterparts in a classic MTV Battle of the Sexes fashion. The women thrashed the men ridiculously in all competitions -- something that was deeply unsettling for the fragile male ego of the Saudis. It was suggested (by Salim and his father before him) that women be barred from driving until they forget how to drive. The hope was that the "good driving gene" would soon phase out of the Saudi women's physiology. 

"Charles Darwin failed us", said Salim. "I told the king to wait for another generation. He wanted to impress Ivanka. And now look what it has wrought", he added wiping his tears with his sleeve.

When approached for a comment, the King's staff told us that the King would issue a public statement on his Twitter account which we have provided below --
