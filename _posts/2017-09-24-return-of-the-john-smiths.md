With the advent of obstrusive Internet search engines it has become increasingly easy to stalk your high school gym teacher's dog. With this in view, residents of Christ City, Maryland have a novel scheme to offer -- change your name to John Smith. 

Or some other generic name like Bob or Mary. 

Celebrity names are also a hit with over a 100 Beyoncés and 48 Justin Biebers registered at the City Office in just the last quarter. 

"I can be sure that anytime someone tries to stalk a Beyoncé who gave them head at a bar in L.A., they are never going to head into my direction", said Beyoncé.

Starbucks baristas have been the worst hit.
