With the advent of obstrusive Internet seach engines it has become increasingly easy to stalk your high school gym teacher's ex-girlfriend's dog. Keeping this mind residents of Christ City, Maryland have a novel scheme to offer -- change your name to John Smith. 

Or some other generic name like Bob Williams or Mary Waters. 

Celebrity names are also a hit with over a 100 Beyoncés and 48 Justin Biebers registered at the City Office in just the last quarter. 

"I can be sure that anytime someone tries to stalk a Beyoncé they once met at a bar in L.A. it is never going to lead them to my Instagram", said Beyoncé.
