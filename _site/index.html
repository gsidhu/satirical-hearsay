          <h4>Call Your PM NOW! But don’t say anything. Your silence is what keeps him going.</h4>

<p>Never one to let a successful PR strategy slide and always a proponent of new and immersive technology (who can forget the great hologram speech of 2014?), reports say that the Prime Minister has been fascinated by the Missed Call campaigns of late. These campaigns were seen most recently in the <a href="http://isha.sadhguru.org/rally-for-rivers/participate-give-a-missed-call-your-vote-to-save-our-rivers/" title="Did I misinterpret their campaign?">Trees For Free</a> project run by the BABA foundation but have been around since <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/06/23/get-1-lac-votes-and-ill-clear-the-word-intercourse-in-jab-har_a_22584233/" title="He said the word. Potty mouth.">this sexual remark</a> by the Chief Censor and <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/%E2%80%98Missed-call%E2%80%99-campaign-makes-a-mark/article17290237.ece">this seditious propaganda</a> in the southern state of Tamil Nadu earlier this year. The Prime Minister’s Office today thus issued a statement stating the PM’s demand that he would do Prime Minsterley work such as brunching with international <del>supermodels</del> dignitaries, rehearsing for his radio show and delivering <em>kadak</em> burns in political rally speeches if and only if he receives 10 million missed calls each morning of the week; barring Sunday because that’s his rest day.</p>

          <p>If you’ve ever been in a situation where you’re unable to decide whether a puppy is cute or not, PETA is here to help.</p>

<p>The umbrella organization of saviours of <em>all</em> animal lives (except a few like humans and those icky slimy ones) has issued a definitive list of dog breeds that you are allowed to display unchecked emotions for. The list, dubbed ‘Cute or Not’, has been welcomed by a number of Social Media Influencers on Instagram, Twitter and Tumblr. One particular social media celebrity, John Smith of @gay&amp;atheist fame, said - “This is a God-send.”</p>

<p>Teenagers across the globe heaved a sigh of relief upon hearing the announcement. One home-schooler named Adam Smith said - “PETA always do me a great concern but now PETA G O O D B O Y E n fren.”</p>

          <p>With the advent of obstrusive Internet seach engines it has become increasingly easy to stalk your high school gym teacher’s ex-girlfriend’s dog. Keeping this mind residents of Christ City, Maryland have a novel scheme to offer – change your name to John Smith.</p>

<p>Or some other generic name like Bob Williams or Mary Waters.</p>

<p>Celebrity names are also a hit with over a 100 Beyoncés and 48 Justin Biebers registered at the City Office in just the last quarter.</p>

<p>“I can be sure that anytime someone tries to stalk a Beyoncé they once met at a bar in L.A. it is never going to lead them to my Instagram”, said Beyoncé.</p>
